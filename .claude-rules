# Claude Code Rules for This Project

## Package Manager

**ALWAYS USE PNPM**

- This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager
- NEVER use `npm` commands
- Always use `pnpm` equivalents:
  - ❌ `npm install` → ✅ `pnpm install`
  - ❌ `npm run build` → ✅ `pnpm run build`
  - ❌ `npm test` → ✅ `pnpm test`
  - ❌ `npm run check:i18n` → ✅ `pnpm run check:i18n`

## Git Commit Policy

**CRITICAL: NEVER AUTO-COMMIT**

- DO NOT use git commit unless explicitly asked by the user with phrases like:
  - "commit this"
  - "create a commit"
  - "git commit"
  - "commit these changes"

- When you complete work, simply inform the user what was changed
- Let the user decide when and how to commit
- The user may want to review changes, test them, or combine multiple changes into a single commit

## What to do instead:
1. Make the requested changes
2. Tell the user what you changed
3. Wait for explicit instructions to commit

## Example:
✅ CORRECT:
User: "Can you fix the bug?"
Assistant: *fixes bug* "I've fixed the bug in src/file.js by..."

❌ INCORRECT:
User: "Can you fix the bug?"
Assistant: *fixes bug and commits* "I've fixed the bug and committed it..."
